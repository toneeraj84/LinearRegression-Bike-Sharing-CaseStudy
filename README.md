## General Information
BoomBikes, a US-based bike-sharing provider, has experienced significant revenue losses due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Struggling to remain competitive in the current market conditions, the company has opted for a data-driven approach to identify the factors influencing shared bike demand.

The company has provided survey data containing extensive information on bike-sharing demand and associated factors across the US.

Business Objective
Develop a predictive model using the survey data.
The model will help analyze the key factors affecting bike-sharing demand.
Insights from the model will enable the business to strategize and plan activities to better manage future demand.

## Conclusions
count= 0.5886+(0.2481yr)-(0.1889windspeed)-(0.2599Spring)-(0.0396Summer)-(0.0764Winter)-(0.1034Jan)+(0.0697Sep)-(0.0462Tuesday)-(0.2986Light_Snow)-(0.0859Mist)

Top 3 Factor that are affecting Bike Sharing Demand:
Season: The seasons Spring, Summer, and Winter show negative coefficients, indicating lower bike-sharing demand during these periods. </br>
Month: January has a negative coefficient, reflecting a decrease in bike-sharing demand, whereas September shows a positive coefficient, marking it as the month with the highest demand. </br>
Weather Conditions: Weather situations like light snow with rain and mist are associated with negative coefficients, suggesting a decline in bike-sharing demand under these conditions.
